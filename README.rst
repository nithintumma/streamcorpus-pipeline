TREC KBA Data
=============

kba.pipeline is a document processing pipeline that assembles
streamcorpus objects from raw data sets for us in TREC KBA.




Wikipedia Links Corpus (WLC)
----------------------------

To make use of the WLC data released by Google, we transform the
original inputs into streamcorpus objects, and grab the raw either
from Brian Martin's initial fetch, or refetch when necessary.
